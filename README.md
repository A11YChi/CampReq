## 1. Overview of A11YChi Camp
A11Y Camp is an extension to the [Chicago Digital Accessibility & Inclusive Design Meetup](http://meetup.com/a11ychi), which holds monthly meetup events on topics related to digital accessibility and inclusive design. The single day event will be held in downtown Chicago and attract 150 digital professionals throughout Chicagoland and beyond to attend 45 minute sessions throughout the day.

Presently, the timing for the day-long camp would be late Summer, early Fall. 

Accessibility considerations will be throughout. There are opportunities to go beyond the norm to reach a wow factor. This includes elevators, ramps, signage in braille.

The event is planned to be catered; the degree depends on the location of the venue and sponsorship support. Ideally, there would be morning "continental breakfast" fare. Hot and cold beverages throughout the day. Lunch may be provided, again, depending on sponsorship support.

All food and beverage must provide a diverse fare, offering individuals options for vegan, lactose intolerance, gluten free, etc. 

Volunteers from the A11YChi meetup will be available to assist with registration, individual's assistance, as well as A/V speaker support.
